# Jack's Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal website, built with [TeXmacs/Mogan](https://mogan.app/) and incorporating the [notes plugin](https://github.com/texmacs/notes).

## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of Illinois Chicago, advised by Prof. [Shuo Han](https://hanshuo.people.uic.edu/site/). I hold a bachelor's degree from the Department of Mathematics at the Southern University of Science and Technology.

My research primarily focuses on reinforcement learning (RL) and game theory. Currently, I am working on projects that combine model-based RL with model-free RL. I have also conducted research on optimization techniques for Stackelberg games.

## Features

- [**Built with TeXmacs/Mogan**](https://mogan.app/): The website is constructed using TeXmacs/Mogan, a scientific editing platform.
- [**Notes Plugin**](https://github.com/texmacs/notes): A custom notes plugin is integrated to enhance the website's functionality. 

## Research Areas

- Reinforcement Learning (RL)
- Game Theory
- Model-Based RL and Model-Free RL
