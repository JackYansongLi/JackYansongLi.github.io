We further show that optimistic posterior sampling can control this Hellinger distance, when we measure model error via data likelihood.

  abstract = {Provably sample-efficient Reinforcement Learning (RL) with rich observations and function approximation has witnessed tremendous recent progress, particularly when the underlying function approximators are linear. In this linear regime, computationally and statistically efficient methods exist where the potentially infinite state and action spaces can be captured through a known feature embedding, with the sample complexity scaling with the (intrinsic) dimension of these features. When the action space is finite, significantly more sophisticated results allow non-linear function approximation under appropriate structural constraints on the underlying RL problem, permitting for instance, the learning of good features instead of assuming access to them. In this work, we present the first result for non-linear function approximation which holds for general action spaces under a linear embeddability condition, which generalizes all linear and finite action settings. We design a novel optimistic posterior sampling strategy, TS\$\^3\$ for such problems. We further show worst case sample complexity guarantees that scale with a rank parameter of the RL problem, the linear embedding dimension introduced here and standard measures of function class complexity.},

  abstract = {There is a long history in game theory on the topic of Bayesian or "rational" learning, in which each player maintains beliefs over a set of alternative behaviours, or types, for the other players. This idea has gained increasing interest in the artificial intelligence (AI) community, where it is used as a method to control a single agent in a system composed of multiple agents with unknown behaviours. The idea is to hypothesise a set of types, each specifying a possible behaviour for the other agents, and to plan our own actions with respect to those types which we believe are most likely, given the observed actions of the agents. The game theory literature studies this idea primarily in the context of equilibrium attainment. In contrast, many AI applications have a focus on task completion and payoff maximisation. With this perspective in mind, we identify and address a spectrum of questions pertaining to belief and truth in hypothesised types. We formulate three basic ways to incorporate evidence into posterior beliefs and show when the resulting beliefs are correct, and when they may fail to be correct. Moreover, we demonstrate that prior beliefs can have a significant impact on our ability to maximise payoffs in the long-term, and that they can be computed automatically with consistent performance effects. Furthermore, we analyse the conditions under which we are able complete our task optimally, despite inaccuracies in the hypothesised types. Finally, we show how the correctness of hypothesised types can be ascertained during the interaction via an automated statistical analysis.},

Based on this model, we derive a solution, called Harsanyi-Bellman Ad Hoc Coordination (HBA), which utilises the concept of Bayesian Nash equilibrium in a planning procedure to find optimal actions in the sense of Bellman optimal control. We evaluate HBA in a multiagent logistics domain called level-based foraging, showing that it achieves higher flexibility and efficiency than several alternative algorithms. We also report on a human-machine experiment at a public science exhibition in which the human participants played repeated Prisoner's Dilemma and Rock-Paper-Scissors against HBA and alternative algorithms, showing that HBA achieves equal efficiency and a significantly higher welfare and winning rate.},

We present a reinforcement learning algorithm with total regret O(DSAT) after T steps for any unknown MDP with S states, A actions per state, and diameter D. This bound holds with high probability. We also present a corresponding lower bound of Omega(DSAT) on the total regret of any learning algorithm. Both bounds demonstrate the utility of the diameter as structural parameter of the MDP.},

We use careful application of concentration inequalities to the optimal value function as a whole, rather than to the transitions probabilities (to improve scaling in \$S\$), and we define Bernstein-based "exploration bonuses" that use the empirical variance of the estimated values at the next states (to improve scaling in \$H\$).},

We devise a learning algorithm running through episodes, in each episode we employ spectral techniques to learn the POMDP parameters from a trajectory generated by a fixed policy. At the end of the episode, an optimization oracle returns the optimal memoryless planning policy which maximizes the expected reward based on the estimated POMDP model. We prove an order-optimal regret bound with respect to the optimal memoryless policy and efficient scaling with respect to the dimensionality of observation and action spaces.},

The analogous question in the PAC learning model [Valiant, 1984] was addressed by Haussler [1992] and others, who showed that the VC dimension characterization of the sample complexity of learnability extends to the agnostic (or ''unrealizable'') setting. In his influential work, Littlestone [1988] described a combinatorial characterization of hypothesis classes that are learnable in the online model. We extend Littlestone's results in two aspects. First, while Littlestone only dealt with the realizable case, namely, assuming there exists a hypothesis in the class that perfectly explains the entire data, we derive results for the non-realizable (agnostic) case as well. In particular, we describe several models of non-realizable data and derive upper and lower bounds on the achievable regret. Second, we extend the theory to include margin-based hypothesis classes, in which the prediction of each hypothesis is accompanied by a confidence value. We demonstrate how the newly developed theory seamlessly yields novel online regret bounds for the important class of large margin linear separators.},

Though there is encouraging empirical evidence that transfer can improve performance in subsequent reinforcement-learning tasks, there has been very little theoretical analysis. In this paper, we introduce a new multi-task algorithm for a sequence of reinforcement-learning tasks when each task is sampled independently from (an unknown) distribution over a finite set of Markov decision processes whose parameters are initially unknown. For this setting, we prove under certain assumptions that the per-task sample complexity of exploration is reduced significantly due to transfer compared to standard single-task algorithms. Our multi-task algorithm also has the desired characteristic that it is guaranteed not to exhibit negative transfer: in the worst case its per-task sample complexity is comparable to the corresponding single-task algorithm.},

Although the study of bandit problems dates back to the 1930s, exploration\textendash exploitation trade-offs arise in several modern applications, such as ad placement, website optimization, and packet routing. Mathematically, a multi-armed bandit is defined by the payoff process associated with each option. In this monograph, we focus on two extreme cases in which the analysis of regret is particularly simple and elegant: i.i.d. payoffs and adversarial payoffs. Besides the basic setting of finitely many actions, we also analyze some of the most important variants and extensions, such as the contextual bandit model.},

Agents that assume their partner to be optimal or similar to them can converge to coordination protocols that fail to understand and be understood by humans. To demonstrate this, we introduce a simple environment that requires challenging coordination, based on the popular game Overcooked, and learn a simple model that mimics human play. We evaluate the performance of agents trained via self-play and population-based training. These agents perform very well when paired with themselves, but when paired with our human model, they are significantly worse than agents designed to play with the human model. An experiment with a planning algorithm yields the same conclusion, though only when the human-aware planner is given the exact human model that it is playing with. A user study with real humans shows this pattern as well, though less strongly. Qualitatively, we find that the gains come from having the agent adapt to the human's gameplay. Given this result, we suggest several approaches for designing agents that learn about humans in order to better coordinate with them.

Adaptive management is the principal tool for conserving endangered species under global change, yet adaptive management problems suffer from a poor suite of solution methods. The common approach used to solve an adaptive management problem is to assume the system state is known and the system dynamics can be one of a set of pre-defined models. The solution method used is unsatisfactory, employing value iteration on a discretized belief MDP which restricts the study to very small problems. We show how to overcome this limitation by modelling an adaptive management problem as a restricted Mixed Observability MDP called hidden model MDP (hmMDP). We demonstrate how to simplify the value function, the backup operator and the belief update computation. We show that, although a simplified case of POMDPs, hm-MDPs are PSPACE-complete in the finite-horizon case. We illustrate the use of this model to manage a population of the threatened Gouldian finch, a bird species endemic to Northern Australia. Our simple modelling approach is an important step towards efficient algorithms for solving adaptive management problems.},

The solutions map belief states to actions. Models of other agents may include their belief states and are related to agent types considered in games of incomplete information.  We express the agents' autonomy by postulating that their models are not directly manipulable or observable by other agents.  We show that important properties of POMDPs, such as convergence of value iteration, the rate of convergence, and piece-wise linearity and convexity of the value functions carry over to our framework.  Our approach complements a more traditional approach to interactive settings which uses Nash equilibria as a solution paradigm.  We seek to avoid some of the drawbacks of equilibria which may be non-unique and do not capture off-equilibrium behaviors.  We do so at the cost of having to represent, process and continuously revise models of other agents. Since the agent's beliefs may be arbitrarily nested, the optimal solutions to decision making problems are only asymptotically computable.  However, approximate belief updates and approximately optimal plans are computable. We illustrate our framework using a simple application domain, and we show examples of belief updates and value functions.},

  abstract = {Bayesian model-based reinforcement learning is a formally elegant approach to learning optimal behaviour under model uncertainty, trading off exploration and exploitation in an ideal way. Unfortunately, finding the resulting Bayes-optimal policies is notoriously taxing, since the search space becomes enormous. In this paper we introduce a tractable, sample-based method for approximate Bayes-optimal planning which exploits Monte-Carlo tree search. Our approach outperformed prior Bayesian model-based RL algorithms by a significant margin on several well-known benchmark problems - because it avoids expensive applications of Bayes rule within the search tree by lazily sampling models from the current beliefs. We illustrate the advantages of our approach by showing it working in an infinite state space domain which is qualitatively out of reach of almost all previous work in Bayesian exploration.},

It extends POMDPs to multi-agent settings by including models of other agents in the state space and forming a hierarchical belief structure. In order to predict other agents' actions using I-POMDPs, we propose an approach that effectively uses Bayesian inference and sequential Monte Carlo sampling to learn others' intentional models which ascribe to them beliefs, preferences and rationality in action selection. Empirical results show that our algorithm accurately learns models of the other agent and has superior performance than methods that use subintentional models. Our approach serves as a generalized Bayesian learning algorithm that learns other agents' beliefs, strategy levels, and transition, observation and reward functions. It also effectively mitigates the belief space complexity due to the nested belief hierarchy.},

Instead of explicitly predicting the opponent's action, we encode observation of the opponents into a deep Q-Network (DQN); however, we retain explicit modeling (if desired) using multitasking. By using a Mixture-of-Experts architecture, our model automatically discovers different strategy patterns of opponents without extra supervision.

They are typically simpler, more flexible to use, and thus more prevalent in modern deep RL than model-based approaches. However, empirical work has suggested that model-free algorithms may require more samples to learn [Deisenroth and Rasmussen 2011, Schulman et al. 2015]. The theoretical question of "whether model-free algorithms can be made sample efficient" is one of the most fundamental questions in RL, and remains unsolved even in the basic scenario with finitely many states and actions. We prove that, in an episodic MDP setting, Q-learning with UCB exploration achieves regret \$\textbackslash tilde\{O\}(\textbackslash sqrt\{H\^3 SAT\})\$, where \$S\$ and \$A\$ are the numbers of states and actions, \$H\$ is the number of steps per episode, and \$T\$ is the total number of steps. This sample efficiency matches the optimal regret that can be achieved by any model-based approach, up to a single \$\textbackslash sqrt\{H\}\$ factor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first analysis in the model-free setting that establishes \$\textbackslash sqrt\{T\}\$ regret without requiring access to a "simulator."},

The introduction of function approximation raises a fundamental set of challenges involving computational and statistical efficiency, especially given the need to manage the exploration/exploitation tradeoff. As a result, a core RL question remains open: how can we design provably efficient RL algorithms that incorporate function approximation? This question persists even in a basic setting with linear dynamics and linear rewards, for which only linear function approximation is needed. This paper presents the first provable RL algorithm with both polynomial runtime and polynomial sample complexity in this linear setting, without requiring a ``simulator'' or additional assumptions. Concretely, we prove that an optimistic modification of Least-Squares Value Iteration (LSVI)\textemdash a classical algorithm frequently studied in the linear setting\textemdash achieves O\textasciitilde (d3H3T------{$\surd$})O\textasciitilde (d3H3T)\textbackslash tilde\{\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}\}(\textbackslash sqrt\{d\^3H\^3T\}) regret, where ddd is the ambient dimension of feature space, HHH is the length of each episode, and TTT is the total number of steps.

To achieve this, existing sample-efficient online RL algorithms typically consist of three components: estimation, planning, and exploration. However, in order to cope with general function approximators, most of them involve impractical algorithmic components to incentivize exploration, such as optimization within data-dependent level-sets or complicated sampling procedures.

Theoretically, we prove that \textbackslash texttt\{MEX\} achieves a sublinear regret with general function approximations for Markov decision processes (MDP) and is further extendable to two-player zero-sum Markov games (MG). Meanwhile, we adapt deep RL baselines to design practical versions of \textbackslash texttt\{MEX\}, in both model-free and model-based manners, which can outperform baselines by a stable margin in various MuJoCo environments with sparse rewards. Compared with existing sample-efficient online RL algorithms with general function approximations, \textbackslash texttt\{MEX\} achieves similar sample efficiency while enjoying a lower computational cost and is more compatible with modern deep RL methods.},

  abstract = {The Partially Observable Markov Decision Process has long been recognized as a rich framework for real-world planning and control problems, especially in robotics. However exact solutions in this framework are typically computationally intractable for all but the smallest problems. A well-known technique for speeding up POMDP solving involves performing value backups at specific belief points, rather than over the entire belief simplex. The efficiency of this approach, however, depends greatly on the selection of points. This paper presents a set of novel techniques for selecting informative belief points which work well in practice. The point selection procedure is combined with point-based value backups to form an effective anytime POMDP algorithm called Point-Based Value Iteration (PBVI). The first aim of this paper is to introduce this algorithm and present a theoretical analysis justifying the choice of belief selection technique. The second aim of this paper is to provide a thorough empirical comparison between PBVI and other state-of-the-art POMDP methods, in particular the Perseus algorithm, in an effort to highlight their similarities and differences. Evaluation is performed using both standard POMDP domains and realistic robotic tasks.},

The algorithm, also known as Thompson Sampling, offers significant advantages over the popular upper confidence bound (UCB) approach, and can be applied to problems with finite or infinite action spaces and complicated relationships among action rewards. We make two theoretical contributions. The first establishes a connection between posterior sampling and UCB algorithms. This result lets us convert regret bounds developed for UCB algorithms into Bayesian regret bounds for posterior sampling. Our second theoretical contribution is a Bayesian regret bound for posterior sampling that applies broadly and can be specialized to many model classes. This bound depends on a new notion we refer to as the eluder dimension, which measures the degree of dependence among action rewards. Compared to UCB algorithm Bayesian regret bounds for specific model classes, our general bound matches the best available for linear models and is stronger than the best available for generalized linear models. Further, our analysis provides insight into performance advantages of posterior sampling, which are highlighted through simulation results that demonstrate performance surpassing recently proposed UCB algorithms.},

  abstract = {This paper formulates the optimal control problem for a class of mathematical models in which the system to be controlled is characterized by a finite-state discrete-time Markov process. The states of this internal process are not directly observable by the controller; rather, he has available a set of observable outputs that are only probabilistically related to the internal state of the system. The formulation is illustrated by a simple machine-maintenance example, and other specific application areas are also discussed. The paper demonstrates that, if there are only a finite number of control intervals remaining, then the optimal payoff function is a piecewise-linear, convex function of the current state probabilities of the internal Markov process. In addition, an algorithm for utilizing this property to calculate the optimal control policy and payoff function for any finite horizon is outlined. These results are illustrated by a numerical example for the machine-maintenance problem.},

  abstract = {Markov decision processes (MDPs) have found success in many application areas that involve sequential decision making under uncertainty, including the evaluation and design of treatment and screening protocols for medical decision making. However, the data used to parameterize the model can influence what policies are recommended, and multiple competing data sources are common in many application areas, including medicine. In this article, we introduce the Multimodel Markov decision process (MMDP) which generalizes a standard MDP by allowing for multiple models of the rewards and transition probabilities. Solution of the MMDP generates a single policy that maximizes the weighted performance over all models. This approach allows the decision maker to explicitly trade-off conflicting sources of data while generating a policy of the same level of complexity for models that only consider a single source of data. We study the structural properties of this problem and show that it is at least NP-hard. We develop exact methods and fast approximation methods supported by error bounds. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness and the scalability of our approach using a case study in preventative blood pressure and cholesterol management that accounts for conflicting published cardiovascular risk models.},

The core idea of transfer is that experience gained in learning to perform one task can help improve learning performance in a related, but different, task.

Many successful reinforcement learning algorithms build on variations of policy-gradient methods, but adapting these methods to RMDPs has been challenging. As a result, the applicability of RMDPs to large, practical domains remains limited. This paper proposes a new Double-Loop Robust Policy Gradient (DRPG), the first generic policy gradient method for RMDPs. In contrast with prior robust policy gradient algorithms, DRPG monotonically reduces approximation errors to guarantee convergence to a globally optimal policy in tabular RMDPs. We introduce a novel parametric transition kernel and solve the inner loop robust policy via a gradient-based method. Finally, our numerical results demonstrate the utility of our new algorithm and confirm its global convergence properties.},

They update their policy in response to the ego agent's behavior, and the ego agent must anticipate these changes to co-adapt. Inspired by humans, we recognize that robots do not need to explicitly model every low-level action another agent will make; instead, we can capture the latent strategy of other agents through high-level representations. We propose a reinforcement learning-based framework for learning latent representations of an agent's policy, where the ego agent identifies the relationship between its behavior and the other agent's future strategy. The ego agent then leverages these latent dynamics to influence the other agent, purposely guiding them towards policies suitable for co-adaptation. Across several simulated domains and a real-world air hockey game, our approach outperforms the alternatives and learns to influence the other agent.},

We propose a parametric Q-learning algorithm that finds an approximate-optimal policy using a sample size proportional to the feature dimension \$K\$ and invariant with respect to the size of the state space. To further improve its sample efficiency, we exploit the monotonicity property and intrinsic noise structure of the Bellman operator, provided the existence of anchor state-actions that imply implicit non-negativity in the feature space. We augment the algorithm using techniques of variance reduction, monotonicity preservation, and confidence bounds. It is proved to find a policy which is \$\textbackslash epsilon\$-optimal from any initial state with high probability using \$\textbackslash widetilde\{O\}(K/\textbackslash epsilon\^2(1-\textbackslash gamma)\^3)\$ sample transitions for arbitrarily large-scale MDP with a discount factor \$\textbackslash gamma\textbackslash in(0,1)\$. A matching information-theoretical lower bound is proved, confirming the sample optimality of the proposed method with respect to all parameters (up to polylog factors).},

  abstract = {We study the exploration problem with approximate linear action-value functions in episodic reinforcement learning under the notion of low inherent Bellman error, a condition normally employed to show convergence of approximate value iteration. First we relate this condition to other common frameworks and show that it is strictly more general than the low rank (or linear) MDP assumption of prior work. Second we provide an algorithm with a high probability regret bound \$\textbackslash widetilde O(\textbackslash sum\_\{t=1\}\^H d\_t \textbackslash sqrt\{K\} + \textbackslash sum\_\{t=1\}\^H \textbackslash sqrt\{d\_t\} \textbackslash IBE K)\$ where \$H\$ is the horizon, \$K\$ is the number of episodes, \$\textbackslash IBE\$ is the value if the inherent Bellman error and \$d\_t\$ is the feature dimension at timestep \$t\$. In addition, we show that the result is unimprovable beyond constants and logs by showing a matching lower bound. This has two important consequences: 1) it shows that exploration is possible using only \textbackslash emph\{batch assumptions\} with an algorithm that achieves the optimal statistical rate for the setting we consider, which is more general than prior work on low-rank MDPs 2) the lack of closedness (measured by the inherent Bellman error) is only amplified by \$\textbackslash sqrt\{d\_t\}\$ despite working in the online setting. Finally, the algorithm reduces to the celebrated \textbackslash textsc\{LinUCB\} when \$H=1\$ but with a different choice of the exploration parameter that allows handling misspecified contextual linear bandits. While computational tractability questions remain open for the MDP setting, this enriches the class of MDPs with a linear representation for the action-value function where statistically efficient reinforcement learning is possible.},

  abstract = {Thompson Sampling has been widely used for contextual bandit problems due to the flexibility of its modeling power. However, a general theory for this class of methods in the frequentist setting is still lacking. In this paper, we present a theoretical analysis of Thompson Sampling, with a focus on frequentist regret bounds. In this setting, we show that the standard Thompson Sampling is not aggressive enough in exploring new actions, leading to suboptimality in some pessimistic situations. A simple modification called Feel-Good Thompson Sampling, which favors high reward models more aggressively than the standard Thompson Sampling, is proposed to remedy this problem. We show that the theoretical framework can be used to derive Bayesian regret bounds for standard Thompson Sampling, and frequentist regret bounds for Feel-Good Thompson Sampling. It is shown that in both cases, we can reduce the bandit regret problem to online least squares regression estimation. For the frequentist analysis, the online least squares regression bound can be directly obtained using online aggregation techniques which have been well studied. The resulting bandit regret bound matches the minimax lower bound in the finite action case. Moreover, the analysis can be generalized to handle a class of linearly embeddable contextual bandit problems (which generalizes the popular linear contextual bandit model). The obtained result again matches the minimax lower bound. Finally we illustrate that the analysis can be extended to handle some MDP problems.},

Toward finding the minimum assumption that empowers sample efficient learning, we propose a novel complexity measure, generalized eluder coefficient (GEC), which characterizes the fundamental tradeoff between exploration and exploitation in online interactive decision making. In specific, GEC captures the hardness of exploration by comparing the error of predicting the performance of the updated policy with the in-sample training error evaluated on the historical data. We show that RL problems with low GEC form a remarkably rich class, which subsumes low Bellman eluder dimension problems, bilinear class, low witness rank problems, PO-bilinear class, and generalized regular PSR, where generalized regular PSR, a new tractable PSR class identified by us, includes nearly all known tractable POMDPs and PSRs. Furthermore, in terms of algorithm design, we propose a generic posterior sampling algorithm, which can be implemented in both model-free and model-based fashion, under both fully observable and partially observable settings. The proposed algorithm modifies the standard posterior sampling algorithm in two aspects: (i) we use an optimistic prior distribution that biases towards hypotheses with higher values and (ii) a loglikelihood function is set to be the empirical loss evaluated on the historical data, where the choice of loss function supports both model-free and model-based learning. We prove that the proposed algorithm is sample efficient by establishing a sublinear regret upper bound in terms of GEC. In summary, we provide a new and unified understanding of both fully observable and partially observable RL.},
