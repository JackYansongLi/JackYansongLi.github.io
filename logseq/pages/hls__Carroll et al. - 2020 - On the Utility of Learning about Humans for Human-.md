- Players place 3 onions in a pot, leave them to cook for 20 timesteps, put the resulting soup in a dish, and serve it, giving all players a reward of 20. The six possible actions are: up, down, left, right, noop, and "interact", which does something based on the tile the player is facing, e.g. placing an onion on a counter.
