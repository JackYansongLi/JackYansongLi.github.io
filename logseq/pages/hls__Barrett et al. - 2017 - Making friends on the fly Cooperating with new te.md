- RL algorithms either model other agents as part of the environment and try to learn the best policy for the single agent given this environment or they consider the case where the whole team is under a single designer’s control.

- fully general ad hoc agent needs two general classes of capabilities: 1) the ability to learn how to act in an environment to maximize reward, and 2) the ability to reason about teamwork and learn about its teammates.

- Previous work in reinforcement learning has largely focused on how an agent should learn about the dynamics of the environment [49, 67], which addresses capability 1. Therefore, this article will leverage this past research and expand this work in the new direction of capability 2: reasoning about the team and social knowledge required for effective teamwork.

- On the other hand, PLASTIC–Model is more scalable to diverse teams. It stores a model of each type of teammate behavior, rather than each team.
