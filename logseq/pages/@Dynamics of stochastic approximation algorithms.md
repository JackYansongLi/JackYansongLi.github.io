- [[Abstract]]
	- These notes were written for a D.E.A course given at Ecole Normale Supérieure de Cachan during the 1996-97 and 1997-98 academic years and at University Toulouse III during the 1997-98 academic year. Their aim is to introduce the reader to the dynamical system aspects of the theory of stochastic approximations.

- # Notes
	- *Section 4* reformulates the stochastic learning algorithm into a continuous process by interpolation. It further proved that the interpolated continuous process form a pseudotrajectory of the semiflow induced by the associated ODE. The upper bound of the distance between the semiflow and the pseudotrajectory is also given in this section under some assumptions. These assumptions are verifiable under certain conditions.
