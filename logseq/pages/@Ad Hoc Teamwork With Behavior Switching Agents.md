- [[Abstract]]
	- As autonomous AI agents proliferate in the real world, they will increasingly need to cooperate with each other to achieve complex goals without always being able to coordinate in advance. This kind of cooperation, in which agents have to learn to cooperate on the ﬂy, is called ad hoc teamwork. Many previous works investigating this setting assumed that teammates behave according to one of many predeﬁned types that is ﬁxed throughout the task. This assumption of stationarity in behaviors, is a strong assumption which cannot be guaranteed in many real-world settings. In this work, we relax this assumption and investigate settings in which teammates can change their types during the course of the task. This adds complexity to the planning problem as now an agent needs to recognize that a change has occurred in addition to ﬁguring out what is the new type of the teammate it is interacting with. In this paper, we present a novel Convolutional-Neural-Networkbased Change Point Detection (CPD) algorithm for ad hoc teamwork. When evaluating our algorithm on the modiﬁed predator prey domain, we ﬁnd that it outperforms existing Bayesian CPD algorithms.
